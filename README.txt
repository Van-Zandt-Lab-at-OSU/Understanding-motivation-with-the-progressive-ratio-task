Because we don’t have the copyright of the empirical data set, we replace it in some files with a simulated data set “simulation_data_80.Rdata”, which is described in the parameter recovery section. The fitting results are stored in “simulation_result_90.Rdata”.

The files “breakpoint_model_stan.R” and “response_time_model_stan.R” contain the formal model and the model for RT, respectively.

The file “plots.R” contains the code to make some of the figures. We replaced the empirical data set with the simulated data set.

The files “Supplement_response.pdf” and “Supplement_RT.pdf” contain the posterior distributions for each individual. Results from selected individuals are presented in the manuscript. The file “supplement_full_individual_boxplots.pdf” contains the posterior box plots for each individual. Results of individuals with schizophrenia are presented in the manuscript.
